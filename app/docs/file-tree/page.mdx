# FileTree

The **FileTree** component is a React-based UI component that displays a hierarchical file structure with support for expanding and collapsing folder nodes.

<ComponentPreview
  component={<FileTreeDemo />}
  filePath="app/docs/file-tree/file-tree-demo.tsx"
/>

## Props Table

| Prop         | Type                         | Default | Description                                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| data         | FileTreeItem[]               | -       | An array of file and folder objects that define the structure of the file tree. |
| initialDepth | number                       | 0       | The initial depth level for the component (used for padding and indentation).   |
| onSelect     | (item: FileTreeItem) => void | -       | A callback function triggered when a file or folder item is clicked.            |

## Usage

To use the FileTree component, you need to import it and pass an array of file/folder objects as the data prop. Optionally, you can provide an onSelect callback to handle item clicks.

```javascript
import { FileTree } from "./FileTree";

const fileData = [
  {
    name: "Folder 1",
    type: "folder",
    children: [
      { name: "File 1.1", type: "file" },
      {
        name: "Folder 1.2",
        type: "folder",
        children: [
          { name: "File 1.2.1", type: "file" },
          { name: "File 1.2.2", type: "file" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  { name: "File 2", type: "file" },
];

<FileTree data={fileData} onSelect={(item) => console.log(item)} />;
```

## Conclusion

The FileTree component is ideal for showcasing or managing hierarchical data structures, such as file systems or nested data representations, in a user-friendly manner. The support for expandable folders and built-in animations makes it an engaging addition to any project.
